<h1>ruemint's Rhythm Game Guide</h1>

<P>As somone who has been playing rhythm games for 3 years and reached #5000 in o!m and #900 in Quaver, I will give you advice on rhythm games (specifically VSRG's) and how to get better at them. This guide will improve on accuracy, stamina, and how to be consistent. Before we begin, this guide is for newer players so more advanced players will be familiar with the advice.</P>
